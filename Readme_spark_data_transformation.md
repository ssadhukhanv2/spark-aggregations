## Spark Setup in Windows

* Install JDK11 from [here](https://jdk.java.net/archive/), set it as JAVA_HOME and add `%JAVA_HOME%\bin` to the system path.
* Install [winutils](https://github.com/steveloughran/winutils) for Hadoop. 
  * [Latest version of winutils]((https://github.com/cdarlint/winutils)) install from here 
  * Download or clone the repo and copy the folder of the latest version available(in our case hadoop-3.2.2) to a location.
  * Set this has HADOOP_HOME to this folder and add `%HADOOP_HOME%\bin` to the system path
* Install Spark 
  * Download Spark from [here](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) and extract it in a folder location
  * Set `SPARK_HOME` variable and add `%SPARK_HOME%\bin` to the system path variable
* Install pyspark in the venv using pip
  * Activate the virtual environment `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
  * Install the pyspark package `pip install pyspark`
* Incase multiple versions of python installed on a machine, ensure Python 3.10 is installed and configure the following environment variables
  * Set `PYTHONPATH` to `C:\Users\subhr\Softwares\spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3\python;C:\Users\subhr\Softwares\spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3\python\lib\py4j-0.10.9.5-src.zip`
  * Set `PYSPARK_PYTHON` to `C:\Program Files\Python310\python.exe` 
    * Without this `PYSPARK_PYTHON` environment variable, running code form pycharm doesn't work, but with this environment variable pyspark from commandline doesn't work `%SPARK_HOME%\bin\pyspark --version`. So while using the commandline change the environment variable name to `PYSPARK_PYTHON_XXXXX`

## Spark Transformations Concepts

* [**Data Transformations within Spark**](https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-spark-programming-in-python-for-beginners/learn/lecture/20495288#overview) The main purpose of spark is to read data from a datasource and apply a series of transformation and then write the transformed data to a data sink for Business usage. In spark, we have two approaches to transforming data.   
  * **Programmic approach**: Here we transform Dataframes with Spark Programs. With this approach we have the flexibility to go beyond the regular SQL expressions.
  * **SQL Expression approach** Here we transform SparkSQL tables with SQL Expressions.
  * **Common Spark transformations**:
    * Combining DataFrames using joins and unions.
    * Grouping and summarizing dataframes using operations such as grouping, windowing and rollups.
    * Applying Functions and Built in transformations on our dataframes such as filtering, sorting,splitting, sampling and finding unique.
    * Using and implementing builtin functions and column level functions.
    * Creating and using User Defined Functions(UDFs)
    * Referencing Rows/Columns and creating custom expressions.
    * Creating column expressions.
* [**DataFrame Rows**](https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-spark-programming-in-python-for-beginners/learn/lecture/20495330#overview) Each Dataframe is a DataSet of Rows. Each row within the dataset is represented using a single object of type row. Scnearios where we may need to directly work with Rows:
   * Manually Creating Rows and Dataframes:
   * Collecting Dataframe rows to driver
   * Work with an individual row in Spark Transformation
* [**Manually Create DataFrames from SparkRDD and Row**](https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-spark-programming-in-python-for-beginners/learn/lecture/20554784#overview) Create DataFrames manually using Row, SparkRDD using [.parallelize()](https://sparkbyexamples.com/spark/how-to-create-an-rdd-using-parallelize/) and Row

      my_schema=StructType([StructField("ID",StringType()),StructField("EventDate",StringType())])
        
      my_rows=[Row("123","04/05/2020"),Row("124","04/05/2020"),Row("125","04/05/2020"),Row("126","04/05/2020")]
        
      my_rdd=spark.sparkContext.parallelize(my_rows,2)
  
      my_df=spark.createDataFrame(my_rdd,my_schema)

* [**Collecting Dataframe rows to Driver**](https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-spark-programming-in-python-for-beginners/learn/lecture/20554784#overview) `my_df` is just a reference to the data sitting in the driver, so within the test we need to explicitly call the .collect() method to collect the rows and bring it to the driver so that we can assert them
        
        rows = utils.to_date_df(dataframe=self.my_df, date_format="M/d/y", column_name="EventDate").collect()
        for row in rows:
            self.assertIsInstance(row["EventDate"], date) 

* [**Work with Dataframe Rows with UnStructured Data**](https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-spark-programming-in-python-for-beginners/learn/lecture/20585510#overview)

* [**Working with Columns**](https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-spark-programming-in-python-for-beginners/learn/lecture/20601288#questions/14666548) We may work with columns either using the `Column String` or the `Column Object`.

      from pyspark.sql.functions import *
      # Read data into DataFrame 
      airlinesDF=spark.read \
        .format("csv") \
        .option("header","true") \
        .option("inferSchema","true") \
        .option("samplingRatio","0.0001") \
        .load("/databricks-datasets/airlines/part-00000")
      
  * Select Columns using `Column String`
      
         airlinesDF.select("Origin","Dest","Distance","FlightNum").show(10)
         # Combine the rows
         airlinesDF.select("Origin","Dest", "Distance","Year","Month","DayofMonth").show(10)

  * Select Columns using `Column Object` (`col`,`column` are essentially same)

         airlinesDF.select(column("Origin"),col("Dest"),"Distance", column("FlightNum")).show()
         # Combine the rows
         airlinesDF.selectExpr("Origin", "Dest", "Distance", "to_date(concat(Year,Month,DayofMonth),'yyyyMMdd') as FlightDate").show(10)
  
  * We may even choose to use column object and column Strings in the same transformation

         from pyspark.sql.functions import *
         airlinesDF.select(column("Origin"),"Dest","Distance", column("FlightNum")).show()
* [**Using User Defined Functions**](https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-spark-programming-in-python-for-beginners/learn/lecture/20655744#questions/14666548) We may want to write custom python functions and want to use them to transform columns data. There are two approaches of doing this.
  * Creating a simple python function and using it as an udf. Here utils.parse_gender is registered as udf, which is used in the column transformation

        parse_gender_udf = udf(utils.parse_gender, returnType=StringType())
  
        survey_df_with_parsed_gender = survey_df.withColumn("Gender", parse_gender_udf("Gender"))
  
        survey_df_with_parsed_gender.select("Age","Gender","Country","State").show(n=5)

  * Another way of using udfs is to use them in sql expressions, but this involves registering the udf to the catalog

        spark_session.udf.register("parse_gender_udf", utils.parse_gender, StringType())
  
        survey_df_with_parsed_gender_with_sql_expr=survey_df.withColumn("Gender",expr("parse_gender_udf(Gender)"))
  
        survey_df_with_parsed_gender_with_sql_expr.select("Age","Gender","Country","State").show(n=5)

* [**Miscellaneous Transformations**](https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-spark-programming-in-python-for-beginners/learn/lecture/20702078#questions)
  * Create Dataframe manually 
  * Add a monotonically increasing id as a column[**monotonically_increasing_id()**](https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.3/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.functions.monotonically_increasing_id.html) monotonically_increasing_id() generates an ID that is guaranteed to be unique monotonically increasing but not consecutive. We can use it to create keys if keys are not present
  * Using case for data transformation
  * Casting Columns to a specific Type
  * Adding new Column to the dataframe
  * Dropping unnecessary columns from dataframe
  * Sorting dataframe in ascending or descending order
